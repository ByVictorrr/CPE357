# pseduo code for mytr

formats:
	1.) mytr 'SET1' 'SET2'
 	2.) mytr -d 'SET'	

var: char *input[];

program:

	get command line arguments
	decide what format the command line arguments are

	IF argument count isnt 3
		print usage wrong
		exit program 
	ELSE
		read line from user
		check the format of command line arugments

		IF format has -d first than a string
			WHILE transversing the input line
				IF any chars in SET is in input line
					delete that character in string line
				ELSE
					print orignal line
				ENDIF
			
		ELSE
			WHILE transversing the input line
				IF any of SET1 characters are in line
					IF SET1 has greater length than SET2
						
						WHILE	SET1 char isnt first char at the index last of SET2 
							relate SET2 last char, get that index, relate that last character to SET1[SET2 last char],....,SET1[SET1]
							delete all elements in SET1 that isnt in line
							delete corresponding elements in SET2 
							get the index in which SET1 chars ar and what char we are searching for in SET1
							use the array indexs where SET1 chars are in line to replace SET2 char in line
				
						Replace SET1 string corresponding to last index of SET2 up to SET1 size with SET2 last char
